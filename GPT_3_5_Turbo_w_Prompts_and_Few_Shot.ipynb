              "'\\nUnnamed: 0: 0\\nNCT Number: NCT03934905\\nStudy Title: Protective Effects of the Nutritional Supplement Sulforaphane on Doxorubicin-Associated Cardiac Dysfunction\\nStudy URL: https://beta.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03934905\\nAcronym: nan\\nStudy Status: RECRUITING\\nBrief Summary: Cardiomyopathy is a major complication of doxorubicin (DOX) chemotherapy, and 10-21% of breast cancer patients receiving DOX experience compromised cardiac function. Recent advancements have increased cancer survivorship but it remains clinically challenging to mitigate the cardiotoxic side effects. Although there are several strategies used to reduce the occurrence and severity of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity, they are not particularly effective. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop new strategies that prevent the cardiotoxic effects of DOX but maintain its potency as a cancer therapy. Because the cellular events responsible for the antitumor activity of DOX and DOX-induced cardiotoxicity are distinctly different, it may be possible to develop therapies that selectively mitigate DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. Thus, the investigators propose to test an adjuvant therapy that combines the phytochemical sulforaphane (SFN) with DOX to attenuate DOX-induced cardiomyopathy. SFN activates the transcription factor Nrf2 and induces defense mechanisms in normal cells. Furthermore, SFN inhibits carcinogenesis and metastases and enhances cancer cell sensitivity to DOX, seemingly through Nrf2-independent mechanisms. SFN has also been tested in several clinical trials, although never together with DOX. Our early animal studies suggest that by activating Nrf2, SFN selectively protects the mouse and rat from DOX cardiotoxicity, enhances survival and enhances the effects of DOX on cancer growth in a rat breast cancer model. The investigators suspect that SFN affects DOX metabolism in cancer cells to enhance tumor regression, or it may synergistically activate other key antitumor mechanisms. Hence, SFN may improve the clinical outcome of cancer therapy by (1) attenuating DOX cardiotoxicity and (2) enhancing the effects of cancer treatment on the tumor. Our hypothesis is that SFN protects the heart from DOX-mediated cardiac injury without altering the antitumor efficacy of DOX. In Aim 1, the investigators will conduct an early-phase clinical trial to determine if SFN is safe to administer to breast cancer patients undergoing DOX chemotherapy. In Aim 2, the investigators will determine if SFN decreases DOX-induced inflammatory responses and enhances Nrf2- and SIRT1-target gene expression in breast cancer patients. Notably, transcript and protein signatures in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) can predict cardiac function in patients undergoing DOX chemotherapy for breast cancer. The investigators will also determine if SFN/DOX treatment activates Nrf2- and SIRT1-dependent gene expression, alters the levels of biomarkers for presymptomatic DOX-cardiotoxicity and mitigates the generation of cardiotoxic metabolites in PBMCs and plasma. These studies will facilitate the development of SFN co-treatment as a strategy to enhance the efficacy and safety of DOX cancer therapy.\\nStudy Results: NO\\nConditions: Anthracycline Related Cardiotoxicity in Breast Cancer\\nInterventions: DRUG: sulforaphane|DRUG: Placebo Oral Tablet\\nPrimary Outcome Measures: Change in cardiac function after DOX therapy with or without sulforaphane through diagnostic studies, 2D Echo will be used to measure cardiac function amongst patients on DOX therapy who are exposed to sulforaphane or placebo., At baseline and 1 year from baseline assessment.\\nSecondary Outcome Measures: Elevation of troponin levels as a surrogate evidence of DOX related cardiotoxicity will be checked at baseline, prior to each DOX therapy and then at 1 year from baseline assessment (Each cycle is 14 days)., Troponin will be used to assess for cardiotoxicity amongst patients on DOX therapy who are exposed to sulforaphane or placebo., At baseline, prior to each cycle of DOX, at completion of 4th cycle of DOX therapy and 1 year from baseline assessment.|Tumor size in patients on DOX therapy with or without sulforaphane treatment will be assessed at baseline, at completion of DOX chemotherapy (4 cycles planned with each cycle being 14 days) and at 1 year from baseline assessment., We will use PET imaging for comparison of change in tumor size for patients on DOX therapy with or without sulforaphane., 2 days before first DOX treatment, 2 days after completion of 4th cycle of DOX therapy and 1 year from first DOX treatment\\nOther Outcome Measures: nan\\nSponsor: Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center\\nCollaborators: nan\\nSex: ALL\\nAge: ADULT, OLDER_ADULT\\nPhases: PHASE1|PHASE2\\nEnrollment: 70\\nFunder Type: OTHER\\nStudy Type: INTERVENTIONAL\\nStudy Design: Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: PREVENTION\\nOther IDs: L19-065\\nStart Date: 2022-06-01\\nPrimary Completion Date: 2025-11-01\\nCompletion Date: 2026-06-01\\nFirst Posted: 2019-05-02\\nResults First Posted: nan\\nLast Update Posted: 2022-07-19\\nLocations: Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, Texas, 79430, United States\\nStudy Documents: Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan|Informed Consent Form\\nEligibility Criteria: Inclusion Criteria:\\n\\nSigned and dated written informed consent.\\nSubjects ≥ 18 years of age.\\nEastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1.\\n\\nClinical stage IV invasive mammary carcinoma or unresectable locoregional recurrence of invasive mammary carcinoma that is:\\n\\nER/PR-positive (> 1% cells) by IHC and HER2 negative (by IHC or FISH)\\nPreviously progressed on an aromatase inhibitor (AI) or a selective estrogenreceptor modulator/ downregulator (SERM; SERD) + a CDK4/6 inhibitor\\nAppropriate candidates for chemotherapy\\nMeasurable disease as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 criteria that has not been previously irradiated and which can be followed by CT or MRI.\\n\\nAdequate organ function including:\\n\\nAbsolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 × 10^9/L\\nPlatelets ≥ 100 × 10^9/L\\nHemoglobin ≥ 9/g/dL (may have been transfused)\\nTotal serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN)\\nAspartate aminotransferase (AST/SGOT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT/SGPT) ≤ 2.5 × ULN (or ≤ 5 × ULN if liver metastases are present)\\nSerum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN or estimated creatinine clearance ≥ 50mL/min as calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault (CG) equation\\nFor randomized patients only: tumors must be diagnosed as non-Luminal A using the Blueprint® and Mammaprint® tests\\n\\nExclusion Criteria:\\n\\nPIK3CA mutation\\nPrior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting\\nMore than 1 line of prior endocrine therapy in the metastatic setting\\nRadiation therapy ≤ 2 weeks prior to study entry.

The purpose of this study is to find out if patients taking a nutritional supplement pill called sulforaphane will help protect against heart damage from doxorubicin. Patients aged 18-89 years old with breast cancer and who are being treated with doxorubicin can take part in the study. There are some other characteristics that may impact if a patient is able to participate. About 70 patients will take part in the study. Participants will be divided into two groups: one group will receive the sulforaphane pill every day, and the other will receive the placebo pill every day (a sugar pill that contains no medicine). Each patient will be “randomized” into either the study group or the placebo group. Randomization means that you are put into a group by chance (like flipping a coin). The patients and their doctors will not know or be able to decide what group they are put in. Patients will participate in the study for 1 year. During this year, heart damage will be measured with blood tests and echocardiograms (a type of image of the heart that can measure heart function). Differences in the blood tests and echocardiograms between patients in the two study groups will be compared to understand if sulforaphane may protect against heart disease caused by doxorubicin.\"\n",

Women with breast cancer that has not spread to other parts of the body, who have recently completed surgery or chemotherapy for their cancer, and who are currently receiving or will soon receive additional cancer medicines can participate in this study. There are some other characteristics that may impact if a patient is able to participate. About 5,400 patients will take part in the study.

Randomization means that you are put into a group by chance (like flipping a coin). The patients and their doctors will not be able to choose what group they are put in.
